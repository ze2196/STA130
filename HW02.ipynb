    "In this session, we discussed several key topics related to skills that are essential in today's modern world, especially in terms of career opportunities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning and Adaptability, Communication, Coding, and Data Analysis**: These are foundational skills that are highly valued across industries, enabling professionals to keep up with technological changes, collaborate effectively, and leverage data for decision-making.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Statisticians and Data Scientists**: We explored why coding and data analysis are integral to these roles, as they enable professionals to handle large datasets, automate processes, and implement statistical models. Tools and automation can assist, but hands-on coding and analysis are still critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Additional Skills for Statisticians**: Beyond coding and data analysis, valuable skills for statisticians include mathematical proficiency, domain knowledge, data visualization, critical thinking, communication, project management, and familiarity with machine learning. Ethical awareness and collaboration are also important.\n",
    "\n",
    "These discussions emphasize the growing complexity of statistical and data-driven roles, where a diverse skill set is key to success."

    "Some of the limitations of Chatbots in discussing skills and career paths are that the Chatbot has limited imformation on myself as a person, and it can be manipulated into giving certain answers depending on the wording of the prompts. For example, if you were to ask a Chatbot about the benefits of a skill or certain career, it would ignore any negatives, possibly giving unrealistic answers. Furthermore, Chatbots do not have the in depth information of someone who has been in a field for years, and mainly gives general information that wont be as useful as discussing the topic with an expert on the topic."
